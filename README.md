# Light-Seeking-Robot
This is a project I worked on by myself which gave me a chance to learn the Arduino programming langauge as well as understand the working principles behind various electronic components such as the HC-SR04 sensor and Arduino UNO Microcontroller. The Code is for a rover that can seek light while avoiding obstacles in its path. It is typically designed for a photocell in the forward facing direction. Modifications can be made to suit various needs.

Enjoy!!!!!!
